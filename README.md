### How do I get set up? ###

* CocoaPods

Please ensure that your system has CocoaPods installed and ready. If not, please follow the steps below:

```
sudo gem update -n /usr/local/bin --system 
sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods 
pod setup
```

Please do not update to a pre version of cocoapods. Stick to stable version.

* Clone and Prepare the Project

```
git clone https://github.com/MohamedElzohirey/twitter.git
cd twitter
pod install
```

You can then double click `twitter.xcworkspace` in order to open the projuect or type in the following in the same terminal.

```
open -a xcode twitter.xcworkspace
```

* **IMPORTANT NOTE**

You **must** open the **`twitter.xcworkspace`** and not the `xcodeproj` file so that you're able to compile
